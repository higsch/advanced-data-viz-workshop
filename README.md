# Advanced data visualization workshop with Svelte and D3

> by Matthias Stahl, 21st June 2021


## Summary

Sometimes standard chart types are not enough to tell a comprehensive story. More customized and more interactive graphics are required. Here the D3 framework jumps in and opens up a plethora of possibilities to design web-based and interactive data visualizations. In this workshop we get to know the basic concepts of D3 and how we can exploit its capabilities to create stunning, truly individual visualizations. The workshop consists of a mix of short lecture sessions and hands-on coding parts. The coding will be performed in "code sandboxes" on the internet.


## Prerequisites

Recommended for participants with at least a basic knowledge of JavaScript.


## Goals

- get a basic understanding of custom data visualization with Svelte and D3
- understand how interactivity can be implemented
- understand how code-based data visualizations are set up


## Schedule

- Welcome, JS level
- Our toolbox: [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [D3](https://d3js.org)
- Our project of the day: Atmospheric CO2 concentrations
- Building it
  - Setting the stage: Custom data visualization within CodeSandbox
  - Drawing a data-driven line
  - Adding interactivity
